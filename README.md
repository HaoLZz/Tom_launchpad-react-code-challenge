  - All posts must be displayed on the home page with options to add, edit and delete.
  - An add post button is required to pop up a modal on click to enable adding a new post.
  - An edit post and a delete post button are needed to edit or delete existing post.
  - A search bar is required to search a specific post by Id.
- On universities page, data coming from API should be displayed.
  - Universities data should be requested by the country name.
  - Country is selected from a dropdown menu and the country list should be fetched from an API
